# Biography

I am a [Lecturer in Statistical Learning](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/people/christopher-nemeth) in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and Lancaster University since 2015. 

I work on problems related to Gaussian processes, Bayesian inference and computational statistics, with a focus on Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo techniques. My current research is focused on Bayesian methods for Big Data and tools for online learning.

<!--- I currently hold an EPSRC fellowship on *Scalable and Exact Data Science for Security and Location-based Data* and 
--->
I am a Co-I on the EPSRC-funded [*Data Science for the Natural Environment*](http://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FR01860X%2F1).

I chair the Royal Statistical Society group on Computational Statistics and Machine Learning [*RSS-CSML*](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rss-csml) and currently vice-chair of the [*Statistical Computing* section](http://www.rss.org.uk/RSS/Get_involved/Sections_and_study_groups/Statistical_Computing_Section/RSS/Get_involved/Sections/Statistical_Computing_Section.aspx?hkey=7f80dcaf-cbb9-490c-82cb-67471fcf1f7d).
