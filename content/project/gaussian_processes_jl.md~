A Gaussian process package for the Julia language. Gaussian processes are a family of stochastic processes which provide a flexible nonparametric tool for modelling data. The package allows for the modelling of Gaussian and non-Gaussian data, where in the case of Gaussian data, the posterior Gaussian process posterior distribution is derived analytically. For non-Gaussian data (e.g. classification), MCMC is used to sample from the non-analytic posterior distribution.
